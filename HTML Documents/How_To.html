		<h3> How To Embed Video </h3> 
		<h6> <p> Stack Overflow mentions that most youtube videos have an embed option which is found by pressing the 
			share button under the video (or by right-clicking the video itself). 
			To embed a Youtube video simply copy and paste the embed code from the video directly into html file. 
			An example of this can be found 
			<a href="Assignment.html"> here </a> or by clicking the "HOME" link above. </p> </h6> 
		<h5> Key Note About Embedding Youtube Videos </h5> 
		<h6> <p> Sometimes when embedding youtube videos you may get an embedded Youtube placeholder 
			but may have a message that says "video unavailable watch on youtube" or something similar. Popular videos such as music videos will not embed onto your page but there are some 
			work arounds for this issue. Visit <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51969269/embedded-youtube-video-doesnt-work-on-local-server"> 
			Stack Overflow </a> for help fixing this issue.
