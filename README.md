## Basic KI Factsheet
This was my first finished website and I decided to create f factsheet of my favorite game. 
This website includes: homepage, gallery, and contact form. (Note: for this project, the contact
form does not have an action link. Therefore, the submit button will not activate..)

## Academy Cinemas
This website was designed using bootstrap 4 CDN (a popular framework for HTML and CSS) with 
my own personal modifications and add-ons of code. It utilizes new concepts such as badges, 
search bars, column layouts, etc.
